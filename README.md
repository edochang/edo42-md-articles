# edo42-md-articles
Welcome to my site where I **e**xplore, **d**iscover, and **o**btain 42 (a playful reference from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy").  Another fun fact, edo is short for Edward.  With all seriousness, the goal of this library is to explore digital tools and technologies to improve other's work and life.  My goal is to share my knowledge to the netizens as an effort to give back to the community as I have learned so much from the community itself.
